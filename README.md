# ECAS 2025 - Transfer Learning Tutorial Materials

This repository contains the tutorial materials for the Transfer Learning workshop at **ECAS 2025**.

## 📚 Overview

This hands-on tutorial introduces fundamental concepts and practical applications of **Transfer Learning** and **Domain Adaptation** techniques. Through interactive Jupyter notebooks, participants will explore how to leverage pre-trained models and adapt them to new domains where training data may be limited or distributed differently.

## 📂 Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive exercises with guided questions and implementations
- **Python Scripts**: Helper functions and utilities for transfer learning algorithms
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets for hands-on practice
